# Use-of-datatypes

## Aim:
To understand the datatypes and know the amount of memory alloted.

## Theory:
There are 5 main and 3 derived datatypes.
1. int: stores whole numbers. eg., 10,0,-1
2. float: stores decimal numbers with single precision. eg., 3.14159
3. double: stores decimal numbers with double precision. eg., 9.81 (it is more accurate than float)
4. char: stores single character. eg., 'a','$'
5. bool: stores either true or false values. eg., true, false

Derived:
1. Arrays
2. Pointers
3. Classes
